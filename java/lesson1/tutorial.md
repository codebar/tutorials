## What is Java
Java is a programming language, it's main selling point is that the code you write is written once and can be run an a variety of Operating Systems and irrespective of devices it is running on be it a computer, a phone or a web browser.

## How does Java Work
* Source - You will write Java source code
* Compiler - Your source will then be processed by a compiler which will check your code for any errors and won't let you compile until the compiler is happy your code will be able to run.
* Output(code) - The compiler will generate a new file written in java bytecode. Any compatible device with Java installed will be now able to now run your application
* Virtual Machine -  The bytecode will be run on the Java virtual machine which in available on a pethera of devices which runs in the billions.

### What you've learned so far
Java is a programming language compiled to bytecode and can be run on a Java virtual machine

## Code Structure in Java

#### Source files
Have the extension .java and will contain class files. These class files make up the building blocks of your code.
```
public class fruit {



}
```
#### Class files
These Class files will contain methods which will be instructions.
```
public class fruit {
  void apple (){

  }
}
```
#### Statements
Statements are a series of instructions.
```
public class fruit {
  void apple (){
    String color = "Green";
  }
}
```
### What you've learned so far
Source files contain __class files__.  
Class files contain __methods__.  
Methods contain __statements__.
