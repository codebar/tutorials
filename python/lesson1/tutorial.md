#Introduction to Python

There is a very good introduction article in [Google Developers Guide](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction)

You can also find resources for beginners on [the Python website](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) and refer to [the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html), where the language basics are explained.
