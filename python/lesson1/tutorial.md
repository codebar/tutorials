#Introduction to Python

There is a very good introduction article in [Google Developers Guide](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction)

Also there are resources for beginners on [the Python website](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/). And you can always refer to [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html) that explains the basics.
