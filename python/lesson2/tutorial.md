title: Playing with variables

In this tutorial we are going to look at variables, user input and decision making.

### Creating a variable

Python allows us to store data in something called variables so that we are able to use this data at a later point. To place an item in a variable we give it a name then set its value. 

Now in the REPL type:

	year = 2015

In this example you have now stored the value `2015` into the variable `year`. See what happens next when you type `year' into the REPL. Does it show it back to you?

How about saving your age into a variable or your lucky number? Have a play around with storing numbers into variables.

### Storing numbers in variables

Now that you are familiar with the use of variables, we are able to combine variables with the maths operations we learnt in the previous tutorial.

Now in the REPL type the following:

	revenue = 1000
	costs = 200
	profit = revenue - costs

Now type `profit` to see the results of this calculation. 

Now work out how much money a sponsor at codebar would spend on pizza if they had 60 students turn up? 

Along with pizza, students and cost, what other variables can you think of that could go into this calculation?

### Storing text in variables

As well as numbers variables are able to store text, known in Python as strings. 

Now in the REPL type:

	name = 'codebar'
	url = "codebar.io"

Now type `name` and `url` to see these strings shown back to you. As you can see Python allows both single and double quotes to denote a string variable. Double quotes are required if there is going to be an apostrophe in the string.

For example:

	message = "I'm a string"

Sometimes you will need to use an apostrophe within a single quote, on occasions like this it is recommended to use string escaping. This would look like:

	message ='I\'m a string'

Try storing a string within a variable without quotes, see what happens? Numbers do not require quotation marks, whereas they are mandatory for storing strings.

Now store some strings in variables that contain apostrophes and some that do not.

What happens when you store a number in a variable wrapped in quotes? 

### Storing user input in variables

Now we are going to look at capturing user input using the python input command. Let's create a variable in which to store the user input. 

Now type this into your REPL: 

	lucky_number = input("What is your lucky number?")

Type back your answer after it asks you.

Now in the REPL type:

	food = input("What is your favourite food?")

When you give the REPL your repsonse make sure you wrap it in quotes as this is storing your response as a string.

Now we are going to put your response into another variable.

Now try:

	my_name = input("What is your name?")
	greeting = "Hello " + my_name

Then type `greeting` into your REPL to receive your message. 

### Decision making using variables

Now that we know how to use variables and know how to store data, let's play around with decision making and changing prints based on your answer. In Python (and many other languages), one of the most common ways in which this is done is using an if statement. For example:

	if number > 3:
		print "Bigger than three"
	elif number < 3:
		print "Smaller than three"

Here we can see that if a number we have passed into this decision making code is bigger than three, we will receive a message telling us so, and the same relevant message if the number is smaller than three.

Also, now that we are getting more in depth with Python, we should say that Python is very particular about tabbing. Tabbing is the indents created when writing code. With Python, if any lines are not indented correctly the code will not run. If you are running into bugs, this is a good place to start.

In this final exercise we are going to ask you the number of coffees you have drank today and then change the statement returned to you, depending on your answer.

Let's create a variable called:

	coffee = input("How many cups of coffee have you consumed today?")

	if coffee  >= 4: 
		print "You have a coffee problem"
	elif:
		print "You do not have a coffee problem"
