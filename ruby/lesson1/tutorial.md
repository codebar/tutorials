## Installing Ruby

Before you begin, you must have Ruby installed on your machine. There are a couple of different ways you can get ruby setup.

- [Download from ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- Setup using [RVM][1] or [rbenv][2]

We recommend using a version manager (you are only able to do that if you are on a UNIX based system like OS X or Linux), so that you can manage different Ruby versions.

Alternatively, if you are having trouble you can create an account on [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) which gives you a ready environment that you can use in the browser.

## Ruby in 100 minutes

There are some great tutorials out there, so to understand Ruby basics we will be going through JumpStart Lab's [Ruby in 100 minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html).

The tutorial is open source, so if you have anything to add to it, you can issue a pull request to [the project on Github](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.markdown).
