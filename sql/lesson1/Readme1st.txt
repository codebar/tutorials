NOTE: These notes relate to my thoughts about the tutorial


1) Reason for using existing Javascript lesson as a template for tut.

Rather than being meant as the final, or even a draft wording, I'm doing this is to help me with the following:

a) the level of student ability to aim at.

b) pacing of instructions, related to a).

c) having a template for instructions, so I can visualize how they fit together


2) tasks.txt

This lists the various steps required for the tut

Note that not all steps will be done by student, e.g. loading of tables with data, and autoincrement'ing of id fields may be best left as something to describe later
